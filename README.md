# PP4-Django-Project - Golf Booking System

![Screenshot of the home page of the site](static/images/homepage.png)

## Site Introduction
I have created this golf booking system site as I play and enjoy golf myself. I like to create my projects around my own personal interests as I am able to put more into it and always want to add more features to improve it. The site is a place where users can book a tee time to play a round of golf, add players too, change the date/time and cancel bookings. The project utilites Django, Bootstrap, HTML Templates, CSS and Python code to allow the user to book a time, edit their booking and cancel their booking.

- Burch's Golf Club/Course does not actually exist it is made up using my surname for the purpose of this project.

## Project Planning
Prior to starting this project deciding what to base it on was hard as I had many options such as; restaurant booking system, car sale/buying site and a golf booking system/website for a golf club. I have always played golf and enjoyed it, other projects have been based on my other interests so I thought it was only right to carry on that theme. It really helps me when creating my projects to do this as I can share my love and passion for my interests through my work. I set out to begin deciding what needed to be on the site by drawing out a flow chart with a pen and paper to help me understand what I needed on/from my site. I then began to create my user stories/issues to really understand the needs of both the user and admin. The site needed to include a booking system which only allows a person to book if they have an account registered, manage their bookings and view bookings. 

## User Experience (UX)

### User Needs
- The Burch's Golf Club website needs to allow a site user to create an account.
- Be able to make a tee time booking adn then view their bookings
- Be able to edit and cancel any bookings they have made
- It must be clear and easy to navigate.
- A site user must be able to find the address and map location of the golf course.
### Colour Scheme
- I decided to use a green/white colour scheme for this project as I think they compliment one another nicely. This creates a great user experience as everything is clear and easily readable. The initial green that I used did not pass the accessibility lighthouse tests so I had to use the prompt to find a darker shade that did pass.
- I also decided to use green as it is a very fitting colour to use when considering that the site is used for booking a round of golf.

### Using Bootstrap
- I decided to import a basic bootstrap navbar from the bootstrap website then modify it to the needs of my site.

### Images
- All images used on this site are from google images and are random courses as Burch's Golf Course does not exist.

## Features
### Home Page
- The home page on this project has been kept simple as this is not the main focus of my project however it serves the purpose of welcoming site users giving them a welcome to the club/website and the course location/address.
- It has been made using bootstrap just like all of the HTML structure on this project, as a result it is fully responsive on all screen sizes utilising a collapsable navbar on smaller devices.

### Booking Page
- The booking page has a login_required attached to the views.py file to ensure that it can only display when an authenticated user is logged in, otherwise the user will be met with the signin page before being able to access the booking page.
- Once the user is signed in then the booking page is displayed, the user is then met with a nice image of the course with a small image with initial information about member and visitor booking.
- Below this, there is a booking form to be filled out alongisde booking instructions and 'your information' this just displays the signed in users account name as they do not require any other information to create an account for the purpose of this project. The booking form only requires the user to select a date and time to submit.

The above image shows the booking page when a user is logged in
- The booking page also has some information below the booking form for information such as green fees, buggy hire and the practise area so that users know what to expect upon arrival.

### My Bookings Page
- Once a user has submitted their booking form and it is successful they will then be redirected to the 'my bookings' page which will display any current or past bookings they have made. I have displayed the information in a table giving each booking its own row.
![Image to show the my booking page with some test bookings](static/images/mybookingtable.png)
- The my bookings page has an 'edit/cancel' button attached at the end of each booking, this is linked to the edit booking page and my edit booking views.py code to allow a user when logged in to change anything about their booking and even delete/cancel it.

## Using Agile
- I do not believe that I have used agile entirely correctly throughout this project as I did not think to add smaller parts of the project like styling and bugs that I came into until my mentor suggested that I needed to add these things.
- Requirements were captured as user stories as issues and put into my 'project' on github for tracking progress. They describe features from the end-user's perspective.
- The project was broken down into smaller, manageable iterations. I tried to not move onto the next part of the project until I was satisfied with the current part.
- Code was committed regularly to the repository ensuring that the project was always in a testable state.

## Testing

### Code Validation and Lighthouse Tests

- I have used the Code Institute python code checker to make sure that my code is valid, here are the screenshots of the results from some files however all files have been checked:

Models.py file validation

Forms.py file validation
![Image to show the python validation for the forms.py file](static/images/formsvalidation.png)
Urls.py file validation
![Image to show the python validation for the urls.py file](static/images/urlsvalidation.png)
Views.py file validation

- I have also validated all of my CSS using the CSS Validator

![Image to show the validated CSS](static/images/cssvalidation.png)

- I have also validated all of my HTML by passing the live URL to the deployed website through the HTML Validation, please note there was 1 error. I have looked into this error and have been unable to resolve however I have attached an image to show where the supposed error is as you can see there is a closing footer tag.

- Next will be all of the pages lighthouse scores

#### Home Page
This score is low because of the iframe importing the google map, I have not been able to find a fix for this.

## Bugs and Fixes

- There was a bug where the booking form would only let you submit if you added a player into the Name: section of the form, this should not be the case, it should submit even if this field is left blank as players should be able to book for just themselves. 

- I had a problem when making my django models for making a booking where once a user had filled out the booking form it was not saving properly to the database and creating the booking, this made me rethink and rewrite my code for the whole booking process to solve it. Once I had re written the code it was working how I wanted it too.

- There was a bug where the successfully signed in alert stays on the page creating an area of blank space between the booking page top image and the navbar that should not be there and it is not possible to scroll up and delete this alert. This bug was fixed when I went back to add in the final messages for telling the user that they have successfully signed in or completed a form anywhere on the site.

### Problems I Had
- Getting the 'book' submit button on the create_booking form view to work, I was able to create/add a booking in the admin view and have it display in the my bookings section when a user was logged in but not able to save a booking correctly when signed in on the 'book a tee' page. 
- To fix the above problem I decided to completely redo my models as they were not working as I had intended so personally I felt that it was easier to
begin to rewrite the models from scratch using different parts of the code that I already had written. This was a good decision as it allowed me to learn from
my mistakes from the previous models and get it right this time. I am very happy with how the final product turned out for the booking form as a result.

### Deployment
- For deploying this project their are many more steps to previous projects. I personally had some issues when trying to get my static files to work on my deployed project through heroku. I later found my issue after about 30-45 minutes of searching that I had not removed the 'collect_static' from my Config Vars on settings of my heroku app.

Steps for deployment:
- Debug must be set to FALSE in the settings.py file
1. Firstly to deploy a project you must create an app on heroku and link your github repository
2. Next add your config for your database URL and secret_key that is in your settings.py file of your django project. Also add a collect static config var which will later need removing.
3. To ready your code to deploy you must use pip3 to install gunicorn and whitenoise (freeze these to local - requirements.txt file), add a Procfile file and add heroku to the allowed hosts in settings.py.
4.  Once I had

## Using Django
- Talk about how I decided to change my models completely and struggles with having to change all of the code that linked together to get it to the front end as I could not figure out how to get the bookings to post/save to the backend without use of the admin panel.
- Talk about how I then had to add an edit button to allow users to edit their booking

### Django Models
- I have a django model that I have created myself that allow an admin to select dates that are available for booking via the admin panel, once the dates have been added to the database any user is then able to see them on a drop down menu when creating a booking.
- I also have another django model created by myself which allows a user to select a time from 4 different time slots to create a booking, these bookings can be viewed when logged in.
